My name is Rohith Siddi. I'm an AI engineer, machine learning enthusiast, and deep learning practitioner. I'm originally from Warangal, and I’ve been passionate about building smart systems ever since I trained my first model in college. Outside of work, I enjoy hanging out with friends, playing badminton, and hitting the gym. I’m always up for learning something new.
